  If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
  a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
    - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

  After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
  reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
  - :help lua-guide
  - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:

  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = " "
vim.g.maplocalleader = " "

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
vim.g.have_nerd_font = true

-- Import options
require("config.options")

-- Import keymaps
require("config.keymaps")

-- Import autocmds
